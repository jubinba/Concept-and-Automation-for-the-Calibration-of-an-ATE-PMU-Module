# Concept-and-Automation-for-the-Calibration-of-an-ATE-PMU-Module
Source code for the automation and calibration of a PMU module.

A Parametric Measurement Unit module is a device that is used for semiconductor testing applications.
A calibration algorithm is vital for proper operation.
Operation of the current calibration algorithm takes up too much time.
A new calibration algorithm has been developed using machine learning algorithm(Linear Interpolation).
